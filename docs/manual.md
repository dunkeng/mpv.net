About
-----

mpv.net is a media player for Windows that has a modern GUI.

The player is based on the popular [mpv](https://mpv.io) media player.
mpv.net is designed to be mpv compatible, almost all mpv features are available,
this means the official [mpv manual](https://mpv.io/manual/master/) applies to mpv.net,
differences are documented in this manual under [Differences compared to mpv](#differences-compared-to-mpv).


Download
--------

[Stable and beta portable and setup via GitHub download](../../../releases)

[Changelog](changelog.md)


Installation
------------

#### Requirements

1. Windows 10 or higher.
2. [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

Internet streaming requires:

- Downloading [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and adding its folder
  to the [user environment variable PATH](https://www.google.com/search?q=user+environment+variable+PATH).
  Alternativly the yt-dlp executable can be saved in the mpv.net executable folder.
- In case of proxy server usage, [manual configuration](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/issues/401).

#### File Associations

File Associations can be registered using the context menu under `Config > Setup`.

After the file associations were registered, it might still be necessary to change the
default app in the Windows settings.

Another way to register file associations is using Windows File Explorer,
select a media file and select `Open with > Choose another app` in the context menu.

[Open with++](#open-with) can be used to extend the File Explorer context menu
to get menu items for [Play with mpv.net](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#play-with-mpvnet) and
[Add to mpv.net playlist](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#add-to-mpvnet-playlist).
Alternativly the `Send To` feature of Windows File Explorer can be used.

#### Path environment variable

In order to use mpv.net in a terminal for advanced use cases,
mpv.net can be added to the Path environment variable, it allows
to run mpv.net in a terminal by typing `mpvnet`. The easiest way
to add mpv.net to path is:

`Context Menu > Config > Setup > Add mpv.net to Path environment variable`

For more information see the [terminal section](#terminal).

Config Folder
-------------

mpv.net searches the config folder at:

1. Folder defined via MPVNET_HOME environment variable.
2. startup\portable_config (startup means the directory containing mpvnet.exe)
3. `%APPDATA%\mpv.net` (`C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\mpv.net`)

The config folder can be easily opened with:

`Context Menu > Config > Open Config Folder`

The most important files and folders in the config folder are:

- `mpv.conf` file containing the mpv configuration.
- `mpvnet.conf` file containing the mpv.net configuration.
- `input.conf` file containing mpv key and mouse input bindings.
- `scripts` folder containing mpv user scripts.
- `script-opts` folder containing user scripts configuration files.


Input and context menu
----------------------

Global keyboard shortcuts are supported via `global-input.conf` file.

The config folder can be opened from the context menu: `Config > Open Config Folder`

A input and config editor can be found in the context menu under `Config`.

The input test mode can be started via command line: `--input-test`

The input key list can be printed with `--input-keylist`.

mpv input.conf defaults:  
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf

mpv input commands:  
https://mpv.io/manual/master/#list-of-input-commands

mpv input options:  
https://mpv.io/manual/master/#input

Before version v7 all bindings and the context menu definition
were defined in the input.conf file, which mpv.net created
in case it didn't exist. This had the disadvantage that mpv.net
lost control over all default bindings and context menu
defaults. This was unfortunate, v7 introduces a new bindings
and context menu design fixing it.

In v7 no input.conf file is created, the default bindings and
context menu is defined internally. input.conf only contains
what is different from the internally defined defaults,
so it works the same as it works in mpv.

For backward compatibility the old input.conf context menu
format with the menu definition using `#menu: ` is still
supported. The new design also allows for a menu customization,
in a sub section called `Custom`. In input.conf it can be
defined like so:

`Ctrl+a  show-text Test  #custom-menu: Test > Test`

Users that have their bindings and context menu customized
before v7 can easily migrate to the new design by deleting
bindings they don't use and remember the shortcut and remove
`#menu:` everywhere, it's important to remove `#menu:`
everywhere in order to enable the new mode/design.


Command Line Interface
----------------------

**mpvnet** [options] [file|URL|PLAYLIST|-]  
**mpvnet** [options] files


mpv properties can be set with the same syntax as mpv, that is:


To enable the border property:

`--border` or `--border=yes`


To disable the border property:

`--no-boder` or `--border=no`


Supported are all mpv properties, they are documented here:

https://mpv.io/manual/master/#properties


mpv has a few non property based switches which are generally not supported in mpv.net.

mpv.net specific options
------------------------

mpv.net specific options can be found in the conf editor searching for 'mpv.net'.

The options are saved in the mpvnet.conf file.

#### --autofit-audio \<integer\>
Initial window height in percent for audio files. Default: 70

#### --autofit-image \<integer\>
Initial window height in percent for image files. Default: 80

#### --queue \<files\>

Adds files to the playlist, requires [--process-instance=single](#--process-instancevalue).
[Open with++](#open-with) can be used to add files to the playlist using File Explorer.

#### --command=\<input command\>

Sends a input command to a running mpv.net instance via command line, for instance
to create global keyboard shortcuts with AutoHotkey. Requires [process-instance=single](#--process-instancevalue).

### Audio

#### --remember-audio-device=\<yes|no\>

### Playback

#### --auto-load-folder=\<yes|no\>

For single files automatically load the entire directory
into the playlist. This option by default is disabled.
The option is deprecated because mpv now has native
support for it using `autocreate-playlist`,
which by default mpv.net sets to `autocreate-playlist=filter`.


### General

#### --menu-syntax=\<value\>

Used menu syntax for defining the context menu in input.conf.
mpv.net by default uses `#menu:`, uosc uses `#!` by default.

#### --process-instance=\<value\>

Defines if more then one mpv.net process is allowed.

Whenever the CTRL key is pressed when files or URLs are opened,
the playlist is not cleared but the files or URLs are appended to the playlist.

External Tools
--------------

### Play with mpv

In order to play videos from sites such as YouTube the Chrome Extension [Play with mpv](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/play-with-mpv/hahklcmnfgffdlchjigehabfbiigleji) can be used.

Due to Chrome Extensions not being able to start a app, another app that communicates with the extension is required, this app can be downloaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/lezj8lwqt5zf75v/play-with-mpvnet-server.7z/file). The extension works only when the app is running, to have the app always running a link can be created in the auto start folder located at:

`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

This will start the app on system start and have it running in the background. When the file association registration of mpv.net was executed then the app should find the location of mpv.net, alternativly the mpv.net folder can be added to the Path environment variable.


### Open With

Alternatively the Chrome/Firefox extension [Open With](../../../issues/119) can be used.


### Open with++

[Open with++](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus) can be used to extend the File Explorer context menu to get menu items for [Play with mpv.net](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#play-with-mpvnet) and [Add to mpv.net playlist](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#add-to-mpvnet-playlist).


### External Application Launcher

Videos can be streamed or downloaded easily with the Chrome extension
[External Application Launcher](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/external-application-laun/bifmfjgpgndemajpeeoiopbeilbaifdo),
for download (recommended):

path: `wt`

args: `-- powershell -NoLogo -Command "yt-dlp --ignore-errors --download-archive 'C:\External Application Button.txt' --output 'C:\YouTube\%(channel)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' ('[HREF]' -replace '&list=.+','')"`


Scripting
---------

#### Lua

A very large collection of user scripts can be found in the GitHub repository
[awesome-mpv](https://github.com/stax76/awesome-mpv). 

Lua scripting is documented in the mpv.net wiki [here](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/wiki/Extending-mpv-and-mpv.net-via-Lua-scripting).

#### JavaScript

[mpv JavaScript documentation](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#javascript)


.NET Extensions
---------------

.NET Extensions are located in a subfolder _extensions_ in the config folder,
the filename must have the same name as the directory:

```Text
<config folder>\extensions\ExampleExtension\ExampleExtension.dll
```


Color Theme
-----------

mpv.net supports custom color themes, the definition of the built-in themes can be found at:

[theme.txt](../../../tree/main/src/Resources/theme.txt)


Custom themes can be saved at:

`<conf folder>\theme.conf`

The theme.conf file may contain multiple themes.

In the config editor under UI there are the options dark-theme and
light-theme to define the themes used in dark and in light mode.


Advanced Features
-----------------

### Playback of VapourSynth scripts

vpy files are supported with following mpv.conf configuration:

```
[extension.vpy]
demuxer-lavf-format = vapoursynth
```

Python and VapourSynth must be in the path environment variable.


Differences compared to mpv
---------------------------

mpv.net is designed to work exactly like mpv, there are a few
differences and limitations:

The configuration folder is named `mpv.net` instead of `mpv`:

`C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\mpv.net`

### Window Limitations

mpv.net implements an own main window which means only mpv window
features are supported that have an own implementation in mpv.net.

A window free mode is currently not supported, the main window is always
visible, even when mpv.net is started from the terminal and music is played.

For mpv.net it's currently not possible to find out where OSC menus are located,
but there are 3 features that require this information, therefore mpv.net
makes the assumption that near the window borders might be OSC menus. As a result
the following three features, work only when invoked from the center of the window:

1. Window dragging (moving the window with the mouse).
2. Showing the context menu.
3. Auto hiding the mouse cursor.

When the mouse is near a window border, these 3 features are not available.
The dead zone sizes are 10% left, top, right and 22% bottom.

The documentation of mpv's window features can be found here:

https://mpv.io/manual/master/#window


**mpv.net has currently implemented the following window properties:**

- [border](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-border)
- [cursor-autohide](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-cursor-autohide)
- [fullscreen](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-fullscreen)
- [keepaspect-window](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-keepaspect-window)
- [ontop](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-ontop)
- [screen](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-screen)
- [snap-window](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-snap-window)
- [title-bar](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-title-bar)
- [title](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-title)
- [window-maximized](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-window-maximized)
- [window-minimized](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-window-minimized)
- [window-scale](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-window-scale)


**Partly implemented or modified:**

#### --autofit=\<int\>

\<int\> Initial window height in percent. Default: 60

#### --autofit-smaller=\<int\>

\<int\> Minimum window height in percent. Default: 10

#### --autofit-larger=\<int\>

\<int\> Maximum window height in percent. Default: 80

#### --geometry\<x:y\>

Initial window location in percent. Default: 50:50 (centered)

Requires Windows 11, on Windows 10 it works slightly incorrect due to invisible borders.

x=0 docks the window to the left side.  
x=100 docks the window to the right side.  

y=0 docks the window to the top side.  
y=100 docks the window to the bottom side.

#### --title-bar=\<yes|no\>

Shows the window title bar. Default: yes

**mpv.net specific window features:**

mpv.net specific window features are documented in the [screen section](#screen).


### Command Line Limitations

mpv.net supports property based mpv command line options which means it supports
almost all mpv command line options.

What is not supported are non property bases options. Non property based options
need an own implementation in mpv.net, so far implemented are:

--ad=help  
--audio-device=help  
--input-keylist  
--profile=help  
--vd=help  
--version  

### Other Limitations

The mpv property [idle](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-idle) can be
used and mpv.net functions accordingly, but Lua scripts always see `idle=yes`
because mpv.net has to set it to function correctly, this is a difficult
to overcome libmpv limitation.


### mpv.net specific options

Options that are specific to mpv.net can be found by entering _mpv.net_
in the search field of the config editor, in the mpv.net manual they are
documented [here](#mpvnet-specific-options).

mpv.net specific options are saved in the file mpvnet.conf and are just
as mpv properties available on the command line.


Environment Variables
---------------------

### MPVNET_HOME

Directory where mpv.net looks for the user configuration.


user-data
---------

Script authors can access the following
[user-data](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#command-interface-user-data) properties:

```
user-data/frontend/name
user-data/frontend/version
user-data/frontend/process-path
```
