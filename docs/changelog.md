# v7.1.1.5 Beta (????-??-??)

- Same as in mpv the `?` and `t-4` keys can be used to show the active
  key bindings on-screen, it supports scrolling and searching.

# v7.1.1.4 Beta (2025-10-05)

  directly into mpv like the osc or console script. It's similar to command_palete.lua. 
- Fix --script-opt not working.
- The mpv.net manual was updated.
- The Turkish translation was updated. A Bulgarian translation was added.
  Thanks to the translators!
- The required Dotnet version changed from 6.0 to 9.0. This drops Win 7 support
  unfortunately. It was done to use new C# language features and make
  the mpv.net project more attractive for new developers to contribute.
  Also most users prefer having the newest runtime.
- auto build has been disabled because it requires updating libmpv and
  mediainfo all the time which is too much manual work.
- The script src/Tools/update-mpv.ps1 has been improved. It's the easiest way
  update mpv and libmpv (x64 and ARM64). Shinshiro has a update script too,
  but it's a lot longer and more complex.

# v7.1.1.3 Beta (2024-10-20)

  `Settings > Setup > Install Command Palette`. The command palette features
  are shown in the menu under 'View > Command Palette'.

- `media-controls=yes` is now enabled by default, this enables play controls
  in the `KDE Connect` android app.
- The mpv.net option `auto-load-folder` by default is now disabled and the
  option is deprecated. The reason for this is mpv has new native support
  for it using `autocreate-playlist`, which mpv.net uses now instead by default.

  context menu item in explorer with multi selection support use my
  [Open with++](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#add-to-mpvnet-playlist) shell extension, as far as I know multi selection
  can not be done using the Registry but only via shell extension

- fix: there was a sound when closed from taskbar
- fix: the log feature was not working

  last playlist position, key bindings: Home, End

### 5.2

- bug fix for single-instance not working with unicode filenames
- bug fix for logo not shown on start
- osd-visibility.js script was removed because the OSC uses too much memory
- youtube-dl was updated
- libmpv was updated to shinchiro 2019-08-04
- in case mpv.net was started from a terminal it sets now the mpv property input-terminal to yes,
  this means mpv.net will now receive and handle input keys from the terminal
- certain command-line properties didn't work (input-terminal, terminal, input-file,
  config, config-dir, input-conf, load-scripts, script, scripts, player-operation-mode)
- the about dialog shows now the mpv version and build date
- the dialog that asks for a config folder has now a cancel option

### 5.1

- the input editor no longer has known limitations, 'alt gr' and ctrl+alt are working now
- the help in the input editor was simplified and the filter logic was improved

- 'Tools > Manage File Associations' was replaced by 'Tools > OS Setup',
  it has now a feature to add and remove mpv.net to and from the Path
  environment variable and the OS default apps settings can be opened (Win 10 only)
- startup folder and config folder being identical was causing a critical issue
  as mpv.net was loading extensions twice and scripts four times, now identical
  folders are no longer permitted
- error messages are shown when unknown scripts and extensions are found in the startup folder
  because user scripts and extensions are supposed to be located in the config folder instead
- changing from maximized to fullscreen did not work
- the search field in the config editor was not always remembered
- new setting remember-volume added, saves volume and mute on exit
  and restores it on start.
- it's now enforced that mpv properties on the command-line and in
  the mpv.conf config file are lowercase, if not a error is shown
- gpu-api vulkan was not working if media files were opened via
  command-line (that included Explorer)
- new setting minimum-aspect-ratio added, minimum aspect ratio for the window,
  this was previously hard coded to 1.3
- new setting auto-load-folder added, for single files automatically load
  the entire directory into the playlist, previously this was forced,
  now it can be disabled
- new setting themed-menu added, follow theme color in context menu,
  default: no. UI related settings have now a separate UI tab in the config editor

  screenshot-format, screenshot-tag-colorspace, screenshot-high-bit-depth,
  screenshot-jpeg-source-chroma, screenshot-template, screenshot-jpeg-quality,
  screenshot-png-compression, screenshot-png-filter
- mpv.conf preview feature added to config editor, it previews the mpv.conf content
- in the entire project the term addon was replaced with the term extension,
  unfortunately this will break user extensions. The reason for this drastic
  change is that there exist too many different terms, addons, addins,
  extensions, modules, packages etc.. mpv.net follows Google Chrome as the worlds
  most popular extendable app, Chrome uses the term Extension.
- a thread synchronization bug was fixed, the shutdown thread was aborted
  if it was running more than 3 seconds, this caused the rating extension
  to fail if it was waiting for a drive to wake up
- a new JavaScript was included to show the playlist with a smaller font size,
  the script is located at startup/scripts

- script engine performance and error handling was improved
- the [scripting wiki page](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/wiki/Scripting) was improved
- the C# scripting host extension was converted from VB to C# because it's not
  only used for hosting but I also use it now to code and debug script code
- there was a copy paste bug in the file association feature resulting in keys
  from mpv being overwritten instead of using mpv.net keys. Thanks to floppyD!
- there was a exception fixed that happened opening rar files
- instead of using the OS theme color there are now default colors
  for dark-color and light-color

### 4.7.7

- on Win 7 the theme color was hardcoded to DarkSlateGrey because
  WPF was returning a bad color on Win 7, this was fixed by reading
  the theme color from the Registry on Win 7. If the theme color
  is identical to the background color it's corrected
- dark-color setting was added to overwrite the OS theme color used in dark mode,
  find the setting on the General tab
- light-color setting was added to overwrite the OS theme color used in non dark mode,
  find the setting on the General tab
- various changes regarding input handling, multi media keys and
  mouse forward/backward were successfully tested
- it's now possible to use a custom folder as config folder,
  A TaskDialog shows five options: 1. appdata mpv.net, 2. appdata mpv (shared with mpv),
  3. portable_config, 4. startup, 5. custom
- slightly increased startup performance, start-threshold setting added.
  Threshold in milliseconds to wait for libmpv returning the video resolution
  before the window is shown, otherwise default dimensions are used as defined
  by autofit and start-size. Default: 1500
- autofit-smaller setting added. Minimum window height in percent. Default: 40%
- autofit-larger setting added. Maximum window height in percent. Default: 75%

- few layout problems were fixed, autosize for instance did not work

### 4.7

- remember-height was replaced with start-size, when start-size is set
  to video the main video starts directly with the native video size,
  before it was starting with the autofit size first and was only
  afterwards resized to the native video size
- on exit the window location can be saved with remember-position
- in the learn window of the input editor underscores were stripped
  because they have a special meaning in WPF labels 
- fix for keys/input not working for MBTN_LEFT_DBL, MBTN_BACK, MBTN_FORWARD
- in the learn window of the input editor support was added for
  mouse left, mouse left double, mouse mid, mouse forward, mouse back
- libmpv was updated to shinchiro 2019-07-07
- when border is none it wasn't possible to minimize the window from
  the task bar because this is the WinForms default behavier. This
  was fixed by calling Spy++ to the rescue and adding WS_MINIMIZEBOX
  in CreateParams

### 4.6

- fix for middle mouse button not working
- fix of logo overlay using a huge amount of memory (thx for the [ghacks article](https://www.ghacks.net/2019/07/05/a-look-at-mpv-net-a-mpv-frontend-with-everything-integration/))
- fix config dialog showing a message about app restart without reason
- when multiple files are selected in File Explorer and enter is
  pressed, the files are opened as selected, the order is random though
  because Explorer starts multiple mpv.net processes concurrently
- libmpv was updated to shinchiro 2019-06-30
- the [mpv.conf defaults](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/blob/main/mpv.net/Resources/mpv.conf.txt) were changed to show a larger OSC
- in case a file is opened that has a aspect ratio smaller then 1.2 then
  the window size will use a aspect ratio of 1.8
- new JavaScript script osc-visibility.js included in the distribution
  under startup\scripts. It sets the OSC to be always on for audio files
  and auto for non audio files

### 4.5

- opening a URL manually no longer uses a input box but uses the clipboard directly
- the manifest was missing the company attribute which caused
  mpv.net not appearing in the 'Open with' menu of the File Explorer,
  thanks to 44vince44 for pointing this out!!!
- new Python and C# script examples were added to the wiki and the scripting and
  extension documentation was improved
- invalid command-line arguments were ignored, now an error message is shown
- a description on how to start mpv.net from Google Chrome was added to the

  description [here](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/blob/main/Manual.md#chrome-extension)
- new config setting remember-height added to remember the window height,
  otherwise the video's native resolution is used
